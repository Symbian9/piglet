OK.  Just type make and you should have a working piglet.

Here's some things to try.  Firstly, the drawings that you create
will all be in the sub-directory ./cells.  Later on, I plan to
implement a search path for drawings.

Notice that piglet creates a graphic window.  The editor is scanning
both the graphic window and the original shell window that you used to
start piglet.  You can either type coordinates, or click them with the
mouse.  The shell window should have a prompt:

MAIN>

----------------- GRID ---------------------

Try playing with the grid.  If you type "gri 20 2;", you'll get a 20x20
grid tick with a skip of two.  You'll see what I mean if you try it.  You
can move your mouse in the graphic area and see the xy coordinates of
the mouse displaying in the upper left corner.

You can also offset the grid.  Try "gri 20 2 5 5;" and notice that the
origin is now at 5,5 instead of 0,0.

Finally, you can make a non-isotropic grid with something like 
"gri 10 20 2 4 7 7";  This form of the command sets:

   gri <xspacing> <yspacing> <xskip> <yskip> <xorig> <yorig>

When entering points with the mouse, the clicks ALWAYS snap to the grid,
giving a powerful way to enter precise coordinates.

The grid also allows an option ":C<0-7>" which will set the color of the
grid to any of the 8 system colors.  For example: "grid :c2 10 2" creates
a red grid.  The colors are "white, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta,
yellow".

You can also turn the grid on with "GRI ON" or off with "GRI OFF". 
Typing "GRI;" with no arguments toggles the grid state.

COMMANDS
--------

All the piglet built-in commands can be abbreviated to just three letters
with one exception.  DISPLAY must be entered as "DISP" or "disp" to
distinguish it from "DIStance".

HELP
----

You can get a list of all commands by typing "?" or "HELP".  You can get a
summary on just one command by typing "HELP <command>".  

There is documentation of the commercial versions of piglet in the
sub-directory "doc".  All these manual pages are copyright either
HP or DurstCad.  Please don't distribute these any further.  I'm sharing
these with potential developers because they provide a blueprint for
developing the code.  They will not be distributed with the public
release of PD_piglet.


----------------- CREATING A CELL  ---------------------

Once you are happy with the grid spacing and color, try adding some
primitives to the drawing.  First give your drawing a name with "edi
mycell".

RECTANGLES
----------

Now try adding a rectangle by typing "ADD R7" then clicking
the two corners of your rectangle with your left mouse button.  You can
add as many rectangles as you want by continuing to click pairs.  The
command can be terminated with a right-click or by typing either a ";"
or another command name at the keyboard.  You can get different colors
by adding R<layer_number>.  The layers cycle mod(8) through the color
table and then cycle through line types.  For example, "ADD R15" is the
same color as "ADD R7", but uses a dot-dash line type.   Later on, the plan
is to implement the PROCESS command which will allows you to to bind 
outline colors, fill patterns, fill colors and so on to specific layer
numbers or names.

As always with piglet, you can either use the mouse to enter coordinates
or the keyboard.  For example, you can type:

	"ADD R22 0,0 100,121;"

to explicitly add precise coordinates without using the mouse.  This is
very handy when you are entering precise coordinates from a table or from 
calculations.  

INPUT
-----

As a final trick, you can use a program to create lines
like the above, print them into a file named "./cells/foo", and then read
them into your current cell using the input command: "INP foo".


COMMAND LINE EDITING
--------------------

Anything typed at the command line goes into a readline buffer.  I have
mine set up with a vi command history binding.  You can change the
binding by editing ~/.inputrc.  My file looks like:

------------ cut here for gnu readline ~/.inputrc file ----------
set editing-mode vi
set keymap vi
------------ cut here for gnu readline ~/.inputrc file ----------

If you don't set anything, I think you get either an emacs or 
up-arrow, down-arrow editing mechanism.

WINDOWING
---------

You can fit the window to the bounding box of the drawing
by typing "WIN :F;".   You can center the drawing on a particular
point by typing "WIN" and then double clicking on any given point.
Clicking two different points will window in on a region.  You can
get a zoom in or zoom out by using "WIN :X<factor>".


LINES
-----

You can add lines with "ADD L<layer_number>".  Keep clicking your
coordinates with your left-mouse button.  Double-clicking on the same point
will terminate the line and still let you create new lines.  Right-clicking
or typing ";" will terminate both the line and the command.

Lines can have width.  Typing "ADD L7 :W20" will let you enter a line
with a width of 20.  The default is a width of zero.

CIRCLES
-------

Circles are added with "ADD C<layer> :R<degrees> XY1 XY2". The ":R" option 
gives the resolution in degrees.  This is handy for making regular polygons.
For instance "ADD C7 :R72" will create a perfect pentagon.  The pentagon
rotates during rubberband drawing such that the second point, XY2, is always
on one of the vertices.  "ADD C7 :R90" is a way to add a rotated square.
"ADD C7 :R120" adds an equilateral triangle.

POLYGONS
--------

Similiar to lines.  The polygons are always closed for you while you are
drawing.  Double clicking terminates but keeps the command active.

NOTES and TEXT
--------------

You can add notes (drawn with zero width strokes) with 

    ADD N<layer> :F<fontsize> "text to be displayed";

Text is drawn with polygons and can be entered with

    ADD T<layer> :F<fontsize> "text to be displayed";

The fontsize is the vertical spacing of the characters that will
produce single-spaced lines of text.  So, a fontsize of :F20 will
produce a capital letter with a height of 15 units.

Other fun options are

    ":M<x|y|xy>"     mirror the text around x,y, or both xy axes
    ":R<angle>"      rotate text by <angle> in degrees
    ":Y<yxratio>"    set y to x ratio to make skinny or fat letters
    ":Z<slant>"      create italics by slanting the text by <slant> degrees

These fonts are defined in NOTEDATA.F and TEXTDATA.F and are easily
changed.  I have quite a few fonts that are derived from the Hershey
font database.  The format is pretty simple and is documented in
readfont.c.

INSTANCES
---------

You can save your drawing with the "SAVE;" command.  You can then 
"EXIT;" and you are ready to "EDI" a new drawing.  This is the fun part 
of piglet.  Try doing "EDI newdrawing" and adding a copy of our previous
drawing as a sub-cell.   Doing "ADD mycell" lets you click to
add copies of your previous drawing "mycell" to "newdrawing".   You
can use options to add copies with scaling, rotation, etc:

    ":M<x|y|xy>"     mirror the text around x,y, or both xy axes
    ":R<angle>"      rotate text by <angle> in degrees
    ":X<factor>"      scale instance by <factor>
    ":Y<yxratio>"    set y to x ratio to make skinny or fat letters
    ":Z<slant>"      create italics by slanting the text by <slant> degrees

This nesting can be arbitrarily deep.  You can "SAVE newdrawing" and
then "EDI biggerdrawing" and add copies of both "newdrawing" and "mydrawing"
into "biggerdrawing".

Also, the subcells are live.  This means that if you finish with a
drawing using sub-drawings of slotted screws, you can change them all to
philips-style screws by simply editing the original definition.  It will
change in all the drawings that have called the cell, no matter how complex
the nesting or the transformations applied.

SAVE
----

When you "SAV" a cell it creates a text file in ./cells/<CELLNAME>.d
The file is human readable and is a nicely formatted transcript of the
exact commands that you typed and moused to create the cell in the first
place.  You can edit this file (carefully) and the textual changes will
take effect next time you start a new piglet and read in the definition.

PURGE
-----

If you want to use textual processing to change a cell that's already
been read into memory, you can "PURGE <cellname>", and then re-edit it.
The second edit will re-read the disk definition including any changes
that have been added.

DEMOS
-----

There are several big drawings in the cells directory.  You can take
a look at these to see how piglet handles thousands of polygons.
Try: 

    "EDI CDRCFR"   a hybrid substrate for a 2.488 GHz phase locked loop
    "EDI tone"     a schematic for a PBX dial tone generator
    "EDI fontest"  an example of all the characters
    "EDI H20919M1" a 24x36 inch 6-layer Printed Circuit Board design
    "EDI testpen"  a sample of all the line types
    "EDI PLAN2"    the floor plans of the two houses on my lot 
    "EDI slic"     a telephone subscriber line interface circui

You can look at the CELL.d files to see the top level definitions or
you can look at the CELL_I file to see the full hierarchical archive
which includes all the sub-cell definitions.  The archive file is fully
self-contained and is suitable for e-mailing a complete design to another
person.

MISSING STUFF
-------------

There are data structures and stubs for OVALS and ARCS.  These and others
should be an easy project.

Most conspicuous is the lack of "DELete", "MOVe", "COPy" and "STRetch". 
This is the next big code push.  I'll start with the "IDEntify" command. 
This will simply pass a coordinate to db_render().  As the screen is
refreshed, the bounding box of every instance will be compared to the
"IDEntify" coordinate.  The top-10 closest primitives will be saved in
sorted order in a linked list.  The best match will be highlighted and
it's name printed to stdout.  If this isn't the one the user had in
mind, then the up/down arrows can be used to roll through the linked
list until the correct primitive is selected. 

Once "IDE" is working, it should be easy to use the functionality to
implement "DEL" and "MOV".

Next priority is the MENU.  This will be a simple text block in the corner
of the display.  It will be a simple gridded block of every piglet command
like:

|ADD  |R|C|L|N|T|O|A|
|EDI |SAV |PUR |WIN |
|COP |MOV |DEL |INP |
|:F|:R|:X|:Y|:M|:Z|||
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|
...

Each cell is color coded so that "DEL" can be something like
red and "EDI" green.  When the mouse is clicked on a menu item,
it simple causes the literal text of the menu to be injected into
the parse stream.  The mechanism for this is already in place and
is used to pass the mouse clicks into the parser as ascii representations
of the mouse coordinates.  With such a simple menu in place, the editing
is quite fast and efficient, requiring the keyboard only for precision 
coordinate or text string entry.

PRINTING
--------

The basic rendering engine creates output consisting of xy() coordinates
for defining a drawing path, jump() commands which move to the next
coordinate without drawing, pen(pen_number) to set colors, and
line(line_type) to set line style.  These should be trivial to convert to
either postscript or HPGL output.  

MACROS
------

The original piglet had macros and command line math evaluation so
you could define more complex functions and type things like:

    ADD R7 0,0 35/2,100+5*sqrt(2);

for computing precise coordinates on the fly.

REVISION CONTROL
----------------

It would be easy to have every SAVE do a "ci -l" on the cell, thereby
keeping revision control on every cell.  

I'm thinking of allowing the user to create variables that are stored with
the cell.  They could look like:

$$F: "some text keyed to F" $$
$$H: "some text keyed to H" $$

The user could then add text to the drawing referencing these variables
with something like:

	ADD T7 :F20 $F;

If one of the variables has the $Id keyword in it, then RCS will substitute
that keyword dynamically with the version number at each checkin.  This
makes it trivial to put a text block in the lower left corner of your
drawing that is always lists the latest rev number for the drawing.

You could also define variables that would make the cell automatically
upgrade to the latest available version, or insist that the version be
frozen at particular rev number.
