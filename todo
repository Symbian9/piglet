Now handles fonts somewhat;
    Needs $FONTPATH
    Doesn't yet pass options to font rendering code
	40point size, pen 1, no rotation, wired in as constants
	options are currently ignored in "gram.y"
    

Add support for [^\$\$.*$] comments in archive

ADD, EDIT, etc need to be case insensitive along with l,r,c,n,t component id's

all drawing must go through draw() so that levels can be handled properly.
currently, fonts have their own mechanism and are not properly blocked out
when setting nesting levels.
