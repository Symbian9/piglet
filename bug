#
# this file is a reminder to myself for things that I've noticed that need
# to be implemented, fixed or thought about.  Things with [x] checks at the
# end have been completed.  Goal is to clean up all outstanding issues 
# before version 1.0
#

[ ] problem in com_wrap()? 
[ ] should all commands do snapxy on coordinates?  Currently handtyped coordinates
    are not snapped.

[+] MACROS, SCRIPTPATH (partially done)
[ ] -next, -region -point soft keys
[ ] fix highlighting - just make it white, no xor-box

[ ] make CHA :MX,MY,etc work on polygons - just redefine with transformed pts - will
    need pivot point  (not so important since we can WRAP them and then CHA them).

[ ] Retrieving something that shares cells with something already being edited
    creates lots of error messages (eg: retrieve slic followed by tone).  

[ ] fixed coredump in db_ident2 by eliminating a selpnt_clear() call at the
    expense of possible memory leak.  partially fixed it by doing selpnt_clear
    in com_move().  Should get rid of multiple uses of selpnt address in
    com_move and com_stretch.  all calls to selpnt_clear() should be in one place.

[ ] make text stretchable

[ ] do_line using static array for reverse boundary storage
[ ] polygons ignore :W option (can implement as a line type?)
[ ] bailing out of STR with ";" leaves bounding box
[ ] saving FOO as BAR should purge any BAR in memory, or at least ask 
[ ] COPY :R should show individual components, not just bounding box
[ ] need autosave feature - time?  number of commands?

[ ] SMA is funny, requiring a double click, but not EOC.  think about better definition.

[ ] CHA :R for fixing font size, orientation, changing graph label font sizes en-masse, etc.

[ ] need an alternative way to draw an arc: center, first point of circumference, second point on circumference, draw cw.

[ ] there is a lag between showing primitives and sub-cells with win :n-1, win:n9
[ ] postscript doesn't carry through line types
[ ] postscript output should optionally be hierarchical
[ ] postscript output should allow filled objects 
[ ] warning message on exit if proc modified from readin.

[x] ADD I should suppress double click (don't add two insts)
[x] some problem printing portrait mode postscript, doesn't fit boundary properly
[x] make text filled.
[x] ADD L: double clicking on same point makes single line in the .d file
[x] cop :r leaves rubber box if terminated with ";"
[x] del :r leaves rubber box if terminated with ";"
[x] limit testing on EQU :F (stipple fill argument)
[x] archiving something with a wrap NONAME instance saves the noname.
[x] SMASH :R
[x] make comma optional between coords
[x] IDE should print out a line that can be cut/pasted
[x] WIN :Z
[x] retrieving smorgasboard bad ident bounding boxes until saved and re-edited
[x] Double wrapping deletes an item! (was bad update of dbhead->prev)
[x] ; doesn't terminate COP
[x] EQU :O<layer> in edit mode  (superceded by WIN :O<layer>);
[x] cut/paste operation in text window
[x] when you do a readin, the global static from token_get is destroyed
[x] token_get(lp, char *word)  crashes when word is bigger than caller's buffer 

[x] ENV variables
[x] SHELL out

[x] make newlines in text/note strings work

[x] postscript has many duplicated lines

[x] make window zoom in/out by middle clicking/hold and drag right/left.  Single middle click centers window.
[x] clipping bug when large lower rectangle cuts bottom half of screen
[x] win command in .d file can have exponential notation
[x] db_highlight should always use WHITE xor, not current grid color, otherwise highlighting
    doesnt work on lines drawn in the same color as grid.
[x] wrap should complain earlier when show is not set
[?] smashing a NONAME with a justified label makes a mess (can't replicate yet)
[x] need to update man page for EQU options
[x] can add l0, but can't CHAnge a line to layer 0
[x] mov doesn't work with point mode yet (redo db_ident to return selpnt struct).
[x] adding a line and then drawing an arrowhead causes coord to be dropped
[x] dropping a rep with COP leaves highlighting on
[x] mov should not obey lock angle
[x] mov :r doesn't move ARCs!
[x] MOV :R should show individual components, not just bounding box
[x] don't let ADD note/text double enter on the same coord
[x] make db_highlight show origin for instance, text, note, circles
[x] str with a double click sets coord to 0,0 - should abort command
[x] STR :R highlights cells with no pull points in BB
[x] STR :R needs dynamic buffer alloc, not just 1024 points
[x] bounding  box for rotated instances draw as unrotated/mirrored
[x] I doesn't work for a move descriptor
[x] a VCC triangle on top of a wire is hard to select, see multibus schematic

[x] need del :r
[x] stop doing callbacks when in menu area
[x] using cell name doesn't work for restrictor in com_move (and others)
[x] wrap won't take an inst name
[x] str sometimes is stuck in :r mode, :p will fix, maybe static variable?
[x] double clicking on STR with a polygon causes a sudden jump in coords.
[x] interaction with MOV and SHO.  Sometimes MOV moves things that have been set "SHO -E".
[x] can allow arbitrary rotations in SMA and WRA if rectangles are converted to polys
[x] make CHA command prohibit shearing and aspecting of NONAMEs
[x] when exiting, don't warn of unsaved NONAMES
[x] smash, including autosmash should handle rotations and mirrors.
[x] automatically smash NONAMES (added is_tmp_rep variable in db_tab definition and set to 1 for auto wraps insts)

[x] if second point of add line is 0,0 will drop coord
[x] search path for font,note,proc,menu

[x] in .d files, WIN command sometimes has scientific notation for points close to zero

[x] com_copy can't do multiple copies with :R because stack is exhausted
[x] autogenerate NONAMES in WRAP
[x] save non-NONAME wrapped devices names when created
[x] MOV doesn't move instances (some problem with db_ident() wildcarding)

[x] working on com_ident to prototype pick by region.

[x] postscript output should be cropped (fixed several subtle bugs...)

[x] let EQU :M take numeric arguments for more line types

[x] bounding box for adding a scaled instance is wrong size


[x] ARCS fail to degenerate properly if three points are collinear

[x] DEL is broken.  When editing PLAN, try deleting the front porch. 
    Lots of other shapes die first.  Ident, on the other hand does the
    right thing.  {was an uninitialized variable problem}

[x] If you edit PLAN, then edit PLAN2, then edit and click on PLAN
    sub-cell, boom!  segfault at line 127 in com_edit(). 

[x] Working on show sets.  Pointer to currep is now passed to all show
    set routines, each rep now has showset structure in DB_TAB.  Just
    need to properly initialize the structures on creation, and then mod
    show_set_modify()...  to use the pointer rather than a global.
