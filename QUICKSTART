type "make" to build binary
type "make install" to install man pages and library 

run "pig" to start the editor

inside piglet type "ret PLAN;"  to unpack a copy of a house floor plan
then type "edi PLAN;" to edit the floor plan drawing.

Do a window fit command to see the whole drawing "win :F;".

unlock the drawing for modification with "SHO #E;" (make Everything
readable/writable (#)).

Now you can add lines with "ADD L<layer> x1,y1 x2,y2...;", or other components.

Remember that all commands must end in either right mouse click, a ";" character,
or the name of another command.

There are a few other archives inside the cells directory.  The archive
files have "_I" as a suffix.  You can unpack them in the same way as
PLAN.  For instance, retrieve "smog" by typing "ret smog;".  You can
then edit the cell with "edi smog;". 

Have fun!
