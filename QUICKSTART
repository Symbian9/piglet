You can type in either the graphic window or the original terminal window.
It is helpful to position the text window so that the last line of
text is visible underneath the graphic window.  You should have your
window system set to "focus follows mouse" so that when you put the
cursor in the text window, it gets the focus but doesn't top itself.

inside piglet type "ret PLAN;"  to unpack a copy of a house floor plan
then type "edi PLAN;" to edit the floor plan drawing.

unlock the drawing for modification with "SHO #E;" (make Everything
readable/writable (#)).

Now you can add lines with "ADD L<layer> x1,y1 x2,y2...;", or other components.

Remember that all commands must end in either right mouse click, a ";" character,
or the name of another command.

If you did a make install, you can get the top level man page with "man piglet"

There are a few other archives inside the cells directory.  The archive
files have "_I" as a suffix.  You can unpack them in the same way as
PLAN.  For instance, retrieve "smorgasboard" by typing "ret smorgasboard;".  You can
then edit the cell with "edi smorgasboard;".

Have fun!
