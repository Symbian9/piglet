/* ************************************************************* 

this set of routines manages the rubber band drawing function for
interactive point selection.  The rubber band shapes are drawn with an
xor function so that drawing a line twice will erase it.  We need to
insure that the first shape drawn after rubber_set_callback() gets
erased before the second shape is drawn, and so on, until the last call
is made by rubber_clear_callback(). 

    rubber_set_callback();
    First call (x1,y1,0):
	    draw x1, y1

    Second call (x2,y2,1)
	    draw x1, y1			# erase last shape
	    draw x2, y2			# drawn new shape

    (N-1)th call (x(n-1),y(n-1), n-1)
	    draw x(n-2), y(n-2)		# erase last shape
	    draw x(n-1), y(n-1)		# draw new shape

    rubber_clear_callback();
    Last call (xn, yn, -1)
	    draw x(n-1), y(n-1)		# erase last shape
	                                # and DONT draw new shape


The callback function manages this behavior by the count variable passed
in the third argument.  When count==0, it only draws the specified
shape.  When count>=0 it always undraws the old shape prior to drawing
the new shape.  When count<=0 it will undraw the old shape, and NOT draw
a new shape.  rubber_clear_callback() is responsible for making the last
call with count=-1.
