The only global variables that have scope across files are
declared in xwin.h:

    /* globals for interacting with db.c */

    extern DB_TAB *currep;   /* defined in db.c */
    extern int quit_now;     /* defined in xwin.c */
    extern int modified;     /* defined in xwin.c */
    extern int need_redraw;  /* defined in xwin.c */
    extern char version[];   /* defined in xwin.c */
