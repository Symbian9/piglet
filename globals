The only global variables that have scope across files are
declared in xwin.h:

    /* globals for interacting with db.c */

    extern DB_TAB *currep;   /* defined in db.c */
    extern int quit_now;     /* defined in xwin.c */
    extern int need_redraw;  /* defined in xwin.c */

    extern char version[];   /* defined in xwin.c */
    extern unsigned int g_width, g_height;	/* display dimensions */

-------------------------------------------------------------

/* global variables that need to eventually be on a stack for nested edits */

struct ed_context {
    int layer;
    int drawon;			/* 0 = dont draw, 1 = draw (used in nesting)*/
    int showon;			/* 0 = layer currently turned off */
    int nestlevel=9;
    int boundslevel=3;
    int X=1;		  	/* 1 = draw to X, 0 = emit autoplot commands */
    DB_TAB *currep;
    int show[MAX_LAYER];
    /* grid variables from xwin */
} ED_CONTEXT;

FILE *PLOT_FD;		/* file descriptor for plotting */

struct view_port {
    int need_redraw;
    unsigned int width, height; 
    /* put all globals for each separate X11 window here */
}
