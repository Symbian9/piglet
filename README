Piglet is a Piglet is a 2-D engineering drawing editor that supports
hierarchical object description. It is inspired by Hewlett-Packard's
proprietary HP PIGLET (Personal Interactive Graphic Layout EdiTor), which later
became the commercial Graffy editor by DURST CAD.

Piglet is a very nearly complete, from scratch, implementation of the original
HP editor.  It has unlimited hierarchy, unlimited layers, a versatile SHOW
command for filtering the layers displayed.

Piglet supports polygons, rectangles, cirles and lines.  SHP reads
autocad font files and can output editable drawings in postscript,
GERBER, HPGL, dxf and pdplot.  It can also output screen captures in PNG
and GIF format. 

I've used piglet to design several integrated circuits, PCB boards and
lots of CNC projects.  Exporting drawings using autocad fonts as pdplot
coordinate files can be trivially editing into G-code, or used with my
velocity profiling program "velo(1)" for directly driving stepper
motors for engraving projects. 

Piglet is small and lean, fitting on an old fashioned floppy (without
the huge directory of SHP fonts).  It's written in C and Xlib is a good
readable/hackable example of a well-thought out professional graphics
editor circa 1986.
